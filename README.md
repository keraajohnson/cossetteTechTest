Thank you for taking the time to review this technical challenge. 

I really enjoyed working with a mobile first design on this challenge and I liked the added challenge of using plain CSS as opposed
to SASS. I used a little code and as few break points as possible to achieve the challenges that were set out for me and I feel
I accomplished all of them. 

While it was difficult to not use any jQuery, I feel as though the JavaScript in this technical challenge proves that I have a 
knack for problem solving and can use both vanilla JS and jQuery well. 

Thanks again!
